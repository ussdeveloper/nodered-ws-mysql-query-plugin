# Technical Specification - WebSocket MySQL Query Server

## Architecture Overview

This Node-RED plugin creates a professional WebSocket server that provides secure, real-time access to MySQL databases with advanced connection management and client authentication.

## Core Requirements

### 1. Authentication System
- Optional password protection for WebSocket connections
- If no password is set, accepts all connections
- Secure connection handshake with client identification

### 2. Database Management
- Dynamic MySQL database selection from available databases
- Connection pooling and management
- Support for multiple concurrent database operations

### 3. WebSocket Server
- Configurable endpoint name
- Real-time SQL query execution
- Array-based response format
- Bidirectional communication support

### 4. Connection Management
- Automatic client identification assignment
- Heartbeat/ping system for connection monitoring
- Automatic cleanup of disconnected clients
- Connection status tracking and reporting

### 5. Client API Specification
```javascript
const connection = new NodeRedWSConnection(endpoint, password?);

// Event handlers
connection.onConnect()      // Connection established
connection.onError()        // Error occurred
connection.onServerPing()   // Server ping received
connection.onDisconnect()   // Connection lost
connection.onHeartbeat()    // Heartbeat status

// Query methods
connection.Query(sqlQuery)                    // Returns Promise
connection.SyncQuery(sqlQuery, timeout?)     // Synchronous with timeout (default: 5000ms)
connection.Status                             // Current connection status
```

## Implementation Architecture

### Server Components
1. **WebSocket Manager** - Handles client connections and routing
2. **Authentication Module** - Manages password verification and client IDs
3. **Database Connector** - MySQL connection pooling and query execution
4. **Heartbeat Monitor** - Client connection health monitoring
5. **Response Handler** - Query result formatting and transmission

### Client Library Features
- Automatic reconnection with exponential backoff
- Promise-based and synchronous query interfaces
- Built-in connection status monitoring
- Error handling and timeout management
- Heartbeat response automation
